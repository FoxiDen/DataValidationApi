Assumptions made:

First names must start with a capital letter, there cannot be a second capital letter in the middle of the first name.

Manually tested with a .txt file since the allowed file formats were not specified in the requirements. To test, I launched the API, used Postman, selected form-data in the request body, and attached a .txt file with the key "file" to send it to the API and receive a response.

Implementation was done using a minimal API rather than a controller-based approach since the requirements did not specify which one was preferred.
